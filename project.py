# This code uses Gradient Descent. The basic idea of gradient descent is to figure out what direction each parameter can go in to decrease error
# by the greatest amount, then nudge each parameter in its corresponding direction over and over again until the parameters for minimum error and
# highest accuracy are found. In a neural network, gradient descent is carried out via a process called backward propagation. We take a prediction,
# calculate an error of how off it was from the actual value, then run this error backwards through the network to find out how much each weight
# and bias parameter contributed to this error. Once we have these error derivative terms, we can nudge our weights and biases accordingly to improve
# our model. Do it enough times, and we'll have a neural network that can recognize handwritten digits accurately.

# To run:
#  - Go to Desktop > Programming > Instrumented-Neural-Network
#  - Type "python Simple-Neural-Network.py"
# 
# To commit changes:
#  - Edit with Visual Studio
#  - git add *
#  - git commit -m "message"
#  - git push

# TODO:
#  - See if there's a way to add X, Z1, A1, Z2, and A2 to the serialized working data.
#  - Add the back propagation data to the serialized working data.
#  - Refactor the code so the number of layers is not hardcoded.
#  - See if it makes sense to serialize the matrices directly, and shift the processing of them to the Javascript code
#  - Add other activation functions.
#  - Consider variations of gradient descent that improve training efficiency: gradient descent with momentum, RMSProp, and Adam optimization. 
#  - Create a package for the refactored neural network code.
