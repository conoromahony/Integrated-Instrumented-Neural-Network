# Integrated-Instrumented-Neural-Network

There may be an issue with train.csv. I got the following message when setting up the project, but I think it's okay because 
the max file size is 100 MB. I think the below is just a warning and not a problem.

remote: warning: See https://gh.io/lfs for more information.
remote: warning: File train.csv is 73.18 MB; this is larger than GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB
remote: warning: GH001: Large files detected. You may want to try Git Large File Storage - https://git-lfs.github.com.
