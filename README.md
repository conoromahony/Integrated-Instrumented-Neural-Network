This project builds on the code started in [Simple Neural Network](https://github.com/conoromahony/Simple-Neural-Network), and then continued in [Instrumented Neural Network](https://github.com/conoromahony/Instrumented-Neural-Network).

### Notes
When setting up this project in GitHub, I received the following message:
```
remote: warning: See https://gh.io/lfs for more information.
remote: warning: File train.csv is 73.18 MB; this is larger than GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB
remote: warning: GH001: Large files detected. You may want to try Git Large File Storage - https://git-lfs.github.com.
```
I think this is only a warning, and not an issue. My understanding is that the maximum file size is 100 MB, and when you work with a file that is greater than 50 MB, but less than 100 MB, you get this warning.
